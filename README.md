# Sales price kaggle project

## Description

In this project I use the random forest regressor to predict house prices.
To do so, I used Python and libraries like Sklearn (regression) and Pandas
(data).

## Details from Kaggle

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.
